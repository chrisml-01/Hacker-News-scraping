# Hacker News scraping

Hacker News is a popular website for everyone to stay up to date with the Tech Industry. 

This program is a slightly neater version of Hacker News, instead of scrolling through the fast-paced website and looking for popular articles, this program only shows articles/news with over <b>100</b> points. 

- This program used the package Beautiful Soup to help parse the scraped data.
